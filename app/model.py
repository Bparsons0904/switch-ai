        Evaluate the following review for a mechanical keyboard switch. A good review should:
        1. Discuss specific characteristics (e.g., {', '.join(self.characteristics)}, etc.)
        2. Provide personal opinions using words like {', '.join(self.sentiment_words)}, etc.
        3. Include switch-related terms such as {', '.join(self.switch_related)}, etc.
        4. Include an overall assessment
        5. In general, a longer review would score higher

    "Smooth linear feel with a slight bump at the bottom. Great for gaming and typing. The sound is a bit louder than I expected, but still acceptable for office use.",
    "These switches feel amazing. The tactile bump is smooth but pronounced, giving excellent feedback while typing. The sound is a deep, satisfying thock without being too loud, and the weight feels just right for extended typing sessions.",
    "The weather was really nice today. I went for a walk and enjoyed the sunshine. Highly recommend walking in good weather!",
